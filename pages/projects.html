                        <p>I developed a Power BI dashboard that showcased essential college data such as grades, GPA,
                            class enrollment dates, and professor ratings. The dashboard consisted of distinct pages
                            dedicated to different aspects of my academic journey. The first page presented my grades
                            and GPA at Lehigh University, providing an overview of my academic performance. The second
                            page focused on NCC grade data, displaying a breakdown of my courses and corresponding
                            grades at Northampton Community College. The third page provided ratings and feedback for
                            Lehigh professors, offering insights into their teaching quality. Lastly, the fourth page
                            featured NCC professor data, providing a similar rating system. By organizing the data into
                            separate pages, the Power BI dashboard offered an organized and intuitive way to explore my
                            academic achievements and evaluate professors.</p>

                            The calculator is a web application created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it is
                            hosted through GitHub Pages. It allows me to input the necessary information to calculate
                            the total time required for testing a wafer. Additionally, I can enter the calculated total
                            wafer time to determine the end time of the testing process. This simple yet effective tool
                            enhances efficiency and helps streamline the testing process in my work environment.</p>

                            I created a Tableau dashboard to keep track of the anime I've watched. The dashboard
                            consists of several pages, each offering different insights into my viewing habits. One page
                            compares my scores with the overall user ratings, giving me a sense of how my preferences

                            explored and the scores I've given, giving me an overview of my anime preferences. Lastly,
                            there's a page dedicated to showcasing the history of the shows I've watched. This Tableau
                            dashboard helps me organize and visualize my anime viewing experience, making it easier to

                            visual appeal of my projects, I utilized software like Photoshop and Illustrator to create
                            eye-catching graphics and illustrations. Additionally, I familiarized myself with design
                            planning tools like Figma and utilized Canva for professional-looking designs. Overall, this
                            class provided a diverse skill set in web development, design, and creative problem-solving.

                        <p>Throughout the duration of a semester-long project, I actively participated in a
                            collaborative effort that involved multiple aspects of software development. My role
                            encompassed database administration, backend development, mobile app development, and
                            project management. As part of the database administration team, I utilized SQL and Java to
                            design and set up tables, creating a solid foundation for efficient data storage and
                            retrieval. The backend development phase involved the use of Java Spark, where I implemented
                            routes to handle client requests, enabling seamless communication between the frontend and
                            backend systems. Mobile app development was another key aspect of the project, and I
                            leveraged the Flutter framework to build a cross-platform application, ensuring wider
                            accessibility. As a project manager, I played a crucial role in overseeing the project's
                            progress, managing timelines, coordinating team members, and ensuring effective
                            communication. Additionally, I actively contributed to documentation efforts, ensuring
                            comprehensive project documentation and conducting thorough research to support
                            decision-making and problem-solving. This extensive and multifaceted experience provided me
                            with a deep understanding of the software development process and the ability to contribute
                            to different areas of the project effectively.</p>
